## Coursework Specification

### Group Submission

### Individual Assessment

### Code Review Meeting

Each group will undertake **four** graded code reviews:

1. Week 3 (20% of CW mark).
2. Week 6 (20% of CW mark).
3. Week 9 (20% of CW mark).
4. Week 12 (20% of CW mark).

The meetings will take place during the lab sessions.  Each group will be given **10 minutes maximum** for the code review.  Your group will be **allocated a time for the code review**.  The details of the individual review points are below.  These meetings **must be attended** at the **stated time**.  Guidelines for grading the group:

- **Being late** for the meeting or **not being ready** when the meeting starts will result in the grade for that review being capped at 40%.
- **Not attending** the meeting will mean the code review will be marked at 0%.

**All team members** should attend the code review, however commitments and other considerations will be taken into account.  **Individuals attendence at reviews will be monitored** to ensure the team is contributing collectively to the project.
