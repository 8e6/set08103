## History of Software Engineering Approaches

- **Pre 1965** work on defining a discipline, but the term Software Engineering unused.
- **1965** various letters to the ACM, lectures, and advertisements mention the term Sofware Engineering.
- **1965** to **1985** the software crisis - software runs over budget, schedule, causes faults that lead to loss of life.  Software quality becomes a key idea (not the focus of this module).
- **1970s** structured programming - using `if`, functions, etc.
- **1980s** Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) - waterfall method of software development.
- **1985** to **1989** *'no silver bullet'* idea - no single technology or approach will solve the software crisis.
- **1990s** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **1990s** Internet becomes dominant technology.
- **1991** Rapid Application Development (RAD) - still common in user-interface design methods.
- **1994** Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) - the first **agile** method.
- **1995** Scrum introduced - a common product management method.
- **1999** eXtreme Programming (XP).
- **2000 to today** rise of lightweight methods (the focus of this module).
- **2000s** various agile methods defined.
- **2001** [The Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/).
- **2008** DevOps (Developer Operations) coined.

## Agile Manifesto

Signatories state that as developers they value:

- **Individuals and Interactions** over *processes and tools*.
- **Working Software** over *comprehensive documentation*.
- **Customer Collaboration** over *contract negotiation*.
- **Responding to Change** over *following a plan*.

- [ ] Reflect on the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and analyse what the individual points mean to you.
- [ ] Read the [Wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto) on the Agile Manifesto.  Reflect how your original analysis is similar and different to that presented on Wikipedia.
