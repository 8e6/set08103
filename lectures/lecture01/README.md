- [ ] **List** the *four points of the Agile Manifesto*.

## What is a Software Engineering Method?

What is a Software Engineering Method?  We have two terms we have to define here:

- **Software Engineering**
- **Method**

### What is Software Engineering?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) (emphasis mine):

> Software engineering is the **application of engineering** to the **development of software** in a **systematic method**.

#### What is Software Development?

The development of software you are probably familiar with in principle, at least from a *programming* perspective.  Software Development is bigger than programming though.  Again from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) (emphasis mine):

> Software development is the process of **conceiving**, **specifying**, **designing**, **programming**, **documenting**, **testing**, and **bug fixing** involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

So we have seven areas defined for software development:

1. **Conceiving** or coming up with an idea.  This is an open-ended question based on personal choice and market need.
2. **Specifying** is coming up with requirements to build the software.  We will only skim across this idea with use case modelling.
3. **Desigining** takes the specification to produce some form of model for the software.  We will do a bit of UML in this module.
4. **Programming** is the one most students are familiar with.
5. **Documenting** is the part most people dislike, but is fundamental for software reuse.  We will touch on areas of documenting.
6. **Testing** is another area people dislike.  We will look at testing and test automation in this module.
7. **Bug fixing** is an area that a lot of time is spent on.  This is not debugging your local code, but fixing bugs in production software.

As you can see, it is likely your software development education has only scratched the surface of software development.  The focus will have been on programming.  We will cover the other areas (except *conceiving*) through this module.

#### What is Engineering?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) (emphasis mine):

> Engineering is the **creative application of science**, **mathematical methods**, and **empirical evidence** to the innovation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations.

Engineering has three strands:

1. The **application of science** - you could say engineering is applied science.  There are a collection of theories underpinning software (*computer science*) which we apply in our development process.
2. **Mathematical methods** really just means any mathematical approach involved in modelling.  We do not do mathematical modelling in the module.  These ideas come from *computer science*.
3. **Empirical evidence** means that we measure something to gain information.  We do this in the module through testing and build automation.

#### What is a Systematic Method?

Is the next main section.

#### So what is Software Engineering?

A collection of techniques (e.g. designing, programming, testing) to develop sofware using ideas from computer science in a manner that is systematic.  We require evidence about our software to determine if it is working as expected.

### What is a Method?

Put simply, a method is just an approach.  We effectively have a series of steps that we follow to get a result.  You may have heard of the *scientific method*.  Method as used in *Software Engineering Methods* is related - we build a process for the development of software.

Most of the ideas of *Software Engineering Methods* can be underpinned by something called the **Software Development Lifecycle**.

#### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

This is the process of developing software from conception through to depoyment and maintenance.  The term has been around since about the 1960s.  The following image illustrates the main phases:

#### Three Key Methods in Software Development

1. Waterfall.
2. Spiral.
3. Agile.

### Linking to Module Learning Outcomes

1. Demonstrate understanding of a modern software development lifecycle.
2. Explain the different techniques supporting modern software engineering methods.
3. Define and analyse systems requirements and needs and specify a system design to deliver these requirements.
4. Apply modern software engineering methods and techniques to a software development project.
5. Explain the role of a computing professional in relation to social, ethical and legal issues surrounding projects.
6. Consider information security requirements in the development and delivery of software.

## History of Software Engineering Approaches

- **Pre 1965** work on defining a discipline, but the term Software Engineering unused.
- **1965** various letters to the ACM, lectures, and advertisements mention the term Sofware Engineering.
- **1965** to **1985** the software crisis - software runs over budget, schedule, causes faults that lead to loss of life.  Software quality becomes a key idea (not the focus of this module).
- **1970s** structured programming - using `if`, functions, etc.
- **1980s** Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) - waterfall method of software development.
- **1985** to **1989** *'no silver bullet'* idea - no single technology or approach will solve the software crisis.
- **1990s** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **1990s** Internet becomes dominant technology.
- **1991** Rapid Application Development (RAD) - still common in user-interface design methods.
- **1994** Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) - the first **agile** method.
- **1995** Scrum introduced - a common product management method.
- **1999** eXtreme Programming (XP).
- **2000 to today** rise of lightweight methods (the focus of this module).
- **2000s** various agile methods defined.
- **2001** [The Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/).
- **2008** DevOps (Developer Operations) coined.

## Agile Manifesto

Signatories state that as developers they value:

- **Individuals and Interactions** over *processes and tools*.
- **Working Software** over *comprehensive documentation*.
- **Customer Collaboration** over *contract negotiation*.
- **Responding to Change** over *following a plan*.

- [ ] Reflect on the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and analyse what the individual points mean to you.
- [ ] Read the [Wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#The_Agile_Manifesto) on the Agile Manifesto.  Reflect how your original analysis is similar and different to that presented on Wikipedia.
