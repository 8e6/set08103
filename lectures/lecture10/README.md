# Lecture 10: Use Cases and User Stories

### Cockburn's Use Case Symbols

A commonly cited text on use cases is *Writing Effective Use Cases* by Alistair Cockburn.  Many of the ideas around use cases in this module are taken from Cockburn's work.  In particular, we consider two aspects: **scope** and **goal level**.

#### Scope

*Design scope* allows us to consider what should be part of our discussions and work to deliver valuable software.  It is *very easy* to add features to software which are not required, add no value, and are therefore doing work for no point.  **As a student you should always be thinking about the scope of your work.**  You may think it best to just do everything, or not plan what you are going to do, but this just leads to wasted effort.  And remember, **waste is our biggest problem when trying to be lean.**

Cockburn suggests a simple simple table
