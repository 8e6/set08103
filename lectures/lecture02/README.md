# Lecture 02: Team Forming

This lecture will be used to form the teams to undertake the assessment.  The notes will overview the general idea of Scrum.

## What is Scrum?

Basic idea - when a project is created, check in regularly to see if the project is going well.  **Inspect and Adapt Cycle** - every so often stop what you are doing and review what has been done to see if you should still be doing it.

Scrum sets a sequence of goals to be completed in a fixed time period (e.g. weekly, monthly).

In Scrum everyone is required to see the end goal and deliver toward it.  Multiple review points mean we can see how people are contributing.

**Plan, but do not blindly follow the plan.**

**Fast failure so you can fix early.**
