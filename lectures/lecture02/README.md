## Recommended Reading

![Scrum Book](img/scrum-book.jpg)

*Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* by Jeff Sutherland.

This is a good read in general.  It will step you through building a Scrum team and process, why Scrum uses the mechanisms it does, and provides an overview of how Scrum operates.  I highly recommend reading the whole book, but at least accessing the appendix on *Implementing Scrum - How to Begin.*
