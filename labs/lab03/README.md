# Lab 03: Requirements and Issue Tracking

In this lab we will use GitHub issues to start tracking our work.  This is stage one of starting a Kanban system to monitor our work.  We will start by defining our **Vision** for the application, using this to define **features**, and from these **User Stories**.

## Behavioural Objectives

## Vision Statement

Here is a cut-down Vision Statement for the product we will develop in the labs:

### Introduction

#### Purpose

The purpose of the application is to manage employee records for a company.  The system will primarily used by the Human Resources Department (HR) and managers.  An existing SQL database exists with this data.

#### Solution Overview

The application will provide a front-end to the employee database with the ability to add, delete, and update records.  This will allow the HR team to be more efficient in processing employee data, and provide managers with information about current salary and role quickly for appraisal meetings.

### User Description

The users are mainly HR advisors who have limited technical knowledge and require reports to be produced and employee records updated.  The HR advisors work via web interfaces mainly, although a desktop application linked to a server is a possible work-around.

### Features

#### Add a New Employee

The application will allow HR advisors to add a new employee when they start.

#### Update an Employee Record

The application will allow an HR advisor to update an employee record.

#### Delete an Employee Record

## Getting Started

You need to set-up your application as [last week](../lab02).  Check that everything works after you've pulled down your code.
